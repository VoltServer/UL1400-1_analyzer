# Usage

See [setup](setup.md) for required setup prior to first use.


## Executing
Main scripts intended for execution are in the root of `ul1400_1_analyzer`.
These need to be run from the repo root to make paths work correctly.

This project is developed with python 3.10, but it may work with earlier
versions at this time.
